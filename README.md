# Mouse Reset
I made this for someone I know whom works with cognitively handicapped children. They have a problem where the child would move a mouse to a certain place, and continue to click on that spot, whether they were picking the right answer or not. This simply moves the mouse back to the middle of the screen, as to prevent that.

I used a lot of resources online to help me. They are listed below:
